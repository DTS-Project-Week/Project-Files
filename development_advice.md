# Development Advice

What are you doing (and equally important, not doing)?

We are trying to achieve a working website where you can easily search for shows you would like to attend, be able to buy tickets for them and add them to the basket. We are not creating a bad website that doesn’t meet the requirements.

Breaking the work down

We are splitting the work between people, where a couple focus on the HTML/CSS some on the SQL and Java implementation. We try to complete the targets set for that day using the MoSCoW method.

Questions

We have asked the client a couple questions such as:

· What level of complexity for the password they want(e.g. 8 characters, capital letters etc)?

· How many characters should a username be (min and max)?

· Should there be a minimum age to be able to book a ticket/create an account and what is that age?

· What is the price of a seat?

How to know when we are done

We will know when we have finished the project if we have ticked all of the requirements on the java_final_project pdf including the MoSCoW tasks. We should have a working website that has all the relevant features e.g. working search bar etc.

Convert the one line requirements into something clear with a goal you can test.

Login/logout screen or facility- allow the user to first sign up with their details to create an account if they haven’t already and ensure they can login with those same details. Allow them to logout if they are already logged in, making sure their details clear after logging out and it returns to the login page. Test: whether the screen goes back to the login page after logging out.

Browse shows and search for a show or a specific date/Display search results- allow the user to look at shows on the website page and implement a search bar for the user to search for a show between dates. Test: see if the show you searched for between specific dates shows up.

Select tickets for purchase, adding them to a ‘basket’- allow the user to choose the tickets they want for a show and once selected ensure they get added to a basket feature which collects all the tickets and allows the user to also remove tickets from the basket. Test: see if the tickets you add to the basket show up in the basket icon.

Communication

As a team, we have signed up to Trello which allows us to brainstorm and store any questions we may want to ask the client. Github is also a useful tool in sharing documents with team members, keeping everyone up to date with the improvements each other make.
